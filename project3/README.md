# Math Quiz Program

A simple console-based quiz program in C++ that tests users' arithmetic skills across various difficulty levels and operation types. Users can select the difficulty level and operation type, answer a set of generated questions, and view their results.

## Features

- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from easy, medium, hard, or mixed difficulty questions.
- **Operation Types**: Select from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or a mix of all operations.
- **Random Question Generation**: Each quiz generates random questions based on selected difficulty and operation type.
- **Result Display**: A summary is displayed at the end, showing the number of correct and incorrect answers and whether the user passed or failed.



## How to Use

Upon starting, the program will prompt the user to:

1. **Choose the number of questions** they would like to answer.
2. **Select a difficulty level**:
   - `1` for easy, `2` for medium, `3` for hard, `4` for mixed levels.
3. **Select an operation type**:
   - `1` for addition, `2` for subtraction, `3` for multiplication, `4` for division, `5` for mixed operations.

The program will then present each question one by one. Users enter their answers, and the program will immediately indicate whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
